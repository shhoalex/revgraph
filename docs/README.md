# revgraph

A minimal deep learning library built using `numpy` as its only dependency.

The project is divided into 2 main parts:

1. `revgraph.core`: A simple computational graph library.
2. `revgraph.dl`: A high-level keras-like deep learning library built entirely
   on top of `revgraph.core`.

Both packages can be used separately.

## Key Features

* Computational Graph
* Automatic Differentiation
* Linear / Logistic Regression
* Deep Learning
