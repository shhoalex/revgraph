## What is this

This project was created with the sole purpose of strengthening my own understanding of how deep learning algorithms work under the hood. It's a "deep learning from scratch" type of project that's not meant to be taken seriously. However, feel free to check out all the codes and use/re-use it :)

## Structure

Project is divided into 2 main parts:

| # | Package | What it does | 
| - | ------ | ------------ |
| 1 | `revgraph.core` | A low-level computational graph library that supports reverse mode AD. |
| 2 | `revgraph.dl`| A high-level keras-like deep learning framework built entirely on top of `revgraph.core` (not implemented yet) |
